# My80vette's N8N Workflow Collection

This repository is a showcase of my N8N workflows, demonstrating my skills and knowledge in automating various tasks and integrations using this powerful platform.

Each branch in this repository contains a single JSON file representing a complete n8n workflow. Feel free to explore, download, and adapt these workflows to your own needs.

## Available Workflows

Here are some of the workflows you can find in this repository (this list will be updated as I add more):

* **Blog Generation Workflow:**  Automates the process of generating blog posts from documents using local LLMs and ensures data privacy with 100% local processing. 

## How to Use These Workflows

1. **Clone the repository:** `git clone https://github.com/My80vette/n8n-workflows.git`
2. **Switch to the branch** containing the workflow you're interested in: `git checkout <branch-name>`
3. **Import the JSON file** into your n8n instance. You can do this by:
    * Going to "Workflows" -> "Import from File" in your n8n editor.
    * Or, using the n8n CLI: `n8n import:workflow --file=<workflow-file.json>`
4. **Configure the nodes** in the workflow according to your specific needs (e.g., API keys, credentials, etc.).
5. **Activate the workflow** and enjoy the automation!
